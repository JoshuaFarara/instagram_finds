# Instagram Finds 
A collection of instagram coding content that is ran and tested on my own. The purpose of this is to practice small problems, keep up with the community, add my 2cents and remix content. Keep myself sharp with industry standards and implement fun tricks and shortcuts by learning from peers!

Visit github repo to see all of the code testing, duplications, remixing and visit my instagram for all of the fun code implementation and display.
