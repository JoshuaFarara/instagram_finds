'''
This quiz is by:

My initial answer is 13. 
Hypothesis: Since the function is called, the x becomes 12, but the function does not return the value of x, 
so when it is printed, it uses the initial variable value of 13.

Debugging: Debug the code to see exactly what is happening. 

Answer: fix the mistake and get a proper output.

Customize: Add your own take or feel to the code, to either get the same output, or to get a more enhanced output or some alteration.
            Explain your process.
